## **Introduction**

While we sometimes live-streamed events, and occasionally used video-conferencing systems prior to the pandemic, events were live by default. The pandemic forced us to rethink this status quo and the resulting necessity of virtual events created both opportunities and challenges.

Virtual events opened up the possibility of having presenters, who for a variety of reasons, it would have been difficult to host onsite even without pandemic restrictions on travel. Technology has enabled us to bridge distances and time zones to bring people together to share their ideas. However, the distance and the lack of the controlled environment of a theatre or other event space posed challenges to producing these events.

This document summarizes the solutions which we have used and are using in the production of virtual events. It outlines the key components of each format, the internal organization and team required. We have tried every combination with varying degrees of success. Each event requires a balance between the immediacy of live interaction and creation of polished videos. Virtual events have two phases of use: a live one broadcasted with some form of live-streaming and reoccurring on-demand one, which requires editing and titling, for video and social media platforms.

To summarize how each of the formats described below address this balance: virtual events via a video conferencing meeting format allow for active engagement from all audience members but is only viable with a small number of participants and audience, and do not result in visually appealing reusable digital content. The webinar format increases the control of the audio-visual content of the event, and thereby its reusability, but limits live interaction to a moderator in discussion with participants and transmitting questions from written chat. The live broadcast via social media, enable registration-free events, and are conducive to pre-recorded edited content with higher production values, but reduce audience interaction to written chat with an invisible moderator.

With the gradual return in-person activities, we have reached another turning point --the introduction of a hybrid event – where either the participants or the audience, or perhaps a part of each is in a physical space, while others remain remote and accessing the event through technology: the lessons of virtual events meet the old practices of in-person ones yet require more than simply a combination of the two. We have only just begun to develop our new hybrid strategies. The hybrid combinations proposed here are starting points for experimentation and testing.
